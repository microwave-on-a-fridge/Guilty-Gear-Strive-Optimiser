# Guilty-Gear-Strive-Optimiser
For those of you who wanna get into GGST but have absolutely garbage computers.
 
Run either optimiseBad.bat or optimseDecent.bat depending on how bad you want/need the graphics to be. These scripts assume that GGST is installed in the C:\ drive, and will not work if it isn't (sorry).

For best results make sure you also change these in-game settings:

Post-Processing - Low
Effect Quality - Best
