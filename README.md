# Guilty-Gear-Strive-Optimiser
For those of you who wanna get into GGST but have absolutely garbage computers.

 
Run either optimiseWindows.bat if you're on Windows, or optimiseLinux.sh if you're on Linux. The scripts should guide you through installation. Please let me know if you encounter any issues.


For best results make sure you also change these in-game settings:


Post-Processing - Low

Effect Quality - Best
